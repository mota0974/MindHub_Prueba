              <h3>General Information</h3>
              <p>
                The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes
                residing Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to
                learn and play hockey. To be a member of MDHL, you must be between the
                ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL ran by o
                small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
                parents and previous league members.
